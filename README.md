# Codevember
A little spin-off from the usual one. Instead of creating visuals, I will write code.

## November 13 - Black Hole
Inspired by the movie Interstellar, this converts how much time has elapsed in Miller's Planet and Earth.

## November 16 - Star
A countdown timer that shows how much left before the Sun dies. Spoiler Alert: around 5 billion years.
